# E-Commerce Shopping
Ruby On Rails Application allows users to select the category of the products. Each category contains multiple products suitable for that specific category. Users can visit the sections and choose the items. Each product has detailed specifications of Name, Price, and Descriptions. 

Admin is allowed to modify the products in the store, add new products, and remove products. In addition, the admin can see the user's id. This app has sign-in and sign-out functionality if someone puts the wrong information that indicates invalid details.
